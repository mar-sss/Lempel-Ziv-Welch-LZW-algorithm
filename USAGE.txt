COMPRESSION:
cmd: "java Encoder <txt file path> <number of bit length of dictionary (max. 16)>"
- e.g. "java Encoder test.txt 12
- it creates two files: one compressed with standart LZW algorithm and one compressed with the enhance of dictionary entries and saves the dictionary too.

DECOMPRESSION:
cmd: "java Decoder <compressed file> <switch> <switch argument>"
switch: -d or -bl
-b switch argument = number of bit length of dictionary (max. 16)
-d switch argument = dictionary file path

- e.g. java Decoder test.lzw -b 12 -> it decompress the file compressed with standard LZW algorithm.
- e.g. java Decoder test.lzw -d test.ser -> it decompress the file compressed with the enhance of dictionary entries
